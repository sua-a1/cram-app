## Recent Auth Changes & Known Issues (2024-01-09)

### Implemented Changes
- Created service client to bypass RLS policies temporarily
- Implemented basic auth flow with sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out
- Added profile creation and organization-based routing
- Updated sign-in form to handle redirects properly
- Fixed join action to use getSession and proper role updates

### Known Issues
1. Email verification callback not working consistently
   - Supabase verification link format differs from expected
   - Need to implement proper token handling

2. Session management inconsistencies
   - Cookie handling needs improvement
   - Auth context needs refinement
   - Session null in join organization flow despite user being logged in
   - Join organization failing silently with "no active session" despite logs showing successful sign-in

3. RLS Policy Bypassing
   - Currently using service role to bypass RLS
   - Need proper policies implemented

### High Priority TODOs
1. Fix email verification flow
2. Improve session management
   - Audit all server actions to ensure consistent getSession usage
   - Debug join organization session issues
   - Implement proper session persistence
3. Implement proper RLS policies
4. Enhance security
   - Limit service role usage
   - Document all bypass points

### Next Steps
1. Complete basic auth flow functionality for MVP
2. Document all security compromises made for MVP
3. Create comprehensive security update plan
