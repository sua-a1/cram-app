## Architecture Decision: Split Authentication Flows

### Context
After analyzing the PRD and architectural guidelines, we've decided to split the authentication flows into two separate systems:
1. Customer Authentication (`/auth/*`)
2. Organization Authentication (`/org-auth/*`)

### Rationale
1. Different Registration Requirements:
   - Customers need simple self-service signup
   - Employees/Admins need complex approval workflow
   - Different form fields and validation rules

2. Security Considerations:
   - Organization users require stricter validation
   - Different RLS policies per role
   - Separate rate limiting and security rules

3. User Experience:
   - Customers get streamlined experience
   - Organization users get role-specific flows
   - Different post-auth redirects

4. Code Organization:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Role-specific components and utilities
   - Easier maintenance and scaling

### Implementation Plan

1. Route Structure:
   ```
   app/
   ├─ (auth)/         # Customer auth
   │  ├─ signin/      
   │  ├─ signup/      
   │  └─ reset/       
   └─ (org-auth)/     # Organization auth
      ├─ signin/      
      ├─ signup/      
      ├─ verify/      
      └─ approve/     
   ```

2. Component Organization:
   ```
   components/
   └─ auth/
      ├─ customer/    # Customer components
      └─ org/         # Organization components
   ```

3. Server Utilities:
   ```
   lib/server/auth/
   ├─ customer.ts     # Customer auth logic
   └─ org.ts          # Organization auth logic
   ```

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Create organization auth routes and layouts
2. Implement role-specific registration forms
3. Set up approval workflow tables
4. Add email domain validation
5. Implement manager approval dashboard
6. Set up security measures (rate limiting, etc.)

### Technical Considerations
1. Auth Flow:
   - Organization signup requires email verification
   - Manager approval through secure dashboard
   - Role and department selection during registration

2. Security:
   - Rate limiting per auth route
   - Email domain validation for organization users
   - Strict input validation
   - Secure session management

3. Database:
   - Separate tables for customer and organization profiles
   - Role-specific RLS policies
   - Approval workflow tracking

### Notes & Decisions
- Using Next.js route groups for clean separation
- Implementing stricter validation for organization auth
- Adding rate limiting and security headers
- Creating role-specific redirect logic
- Maintaining separate components for better organization

### Recent Changes & Updates
