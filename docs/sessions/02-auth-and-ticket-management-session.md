## Architecture Decision: Split Authentication Flows

### Context
After analyzing the PRD and architectural guidelines, we've decided to split the authentication flows into two separate systems:
1. Customer Authentication (`/auth/*`)
2. Organization Authentication (`/org-auth/*`)

### Rationale
1. Different Registration Requirements:
   - Customers need simple self-service signup
   - Employees/Admins need complex approval workflow
   - Different form fields and validation rules

2. Security Considerations:
   - Organization users require stricter validation
   - Different RLS policies per role
   - Separate rate limiting and security rules

3. User Experience:
   - Customers get streamlined experience
   - Organization users get role-specific flows
   - Different post-auth redirects

4. Code Organization:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Role-specific components and utilities
   - Easier maintenance and scaling

### Implementation Plan

1. Route Structure:
   ```
   app/
   ├─ (auth)/         # Customer auth
   │  ├─ signin/      
   │  ├─ signup/      
   │  └─ reset/       
   └─ (org-auth)/     # Organization auth
      ├─ signin/      
      ├─ signup/      
      ├─ verify/      
      └─ approve/     
   ```

2. Component Organization:
   ```
   components/
   └─ auth/
      ├─ customer/    # Customer components
      └─ org/         # Organization components
   ```

3. Server Utilities:
   ```
   lib/server/auth/
   ├─ customer.ts     # Customer auth logic
   └─ org.ts          # Organization auth logic
   ```

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Create organization auth routes and layouts
2. Implement role-specific registration forms
3. Set up approval workflow tables
4. Add email domain validation
5. Implement manager approval dashboard
6. Set up security measures (rate limiting, etc.)

### Technical Considerations
1. Auth Flow:
   - Organization signup requires email verification
   - Manager approval through secure dashboard
   - Role and department selection during registration

2. Security:
   - Rate limiting per auth route
   - Email domain validation for organization users
   - Strict input validation
   - Secure session management

3. Database:
   - Separate tables for customer and organization profiles
   - Role-specific RLS policies
   - Approval workflow tracking

## Latest Changes: Organization Route Structure & Access Flow

### Route Structure Updates
Implemented a new organization-specific route structure following Next.js best practices:
```
src/app/(org)/
├── org/              # Public org routes
│   ├── signin/       # Sign in
│   ├── signup/       # Sign up
│   ├── access/       # Get org access
│   └── register/     # Register new org
└── [orgId]/          # Dynamic org routes
    ├── layout.tsx    # Shared org layout
    ├── (admin)/      # Admin routes
    │   ├── layout.tsx  # Admin layout
    │   └── page.tsx    # Admin dashboard
    └── (employee)/   # Employee routes
        ├── layout.tsx  # Employee layout
        └── page.tsx    # Employee dashboard
```

### Access Flow Implementation
1. Sign-in Flow:
   - After successful sign-in, check user's profile for `org_id`
   - If no `org_id`, redirect to `/org/access`
   - If has `org_id`, redirect to role-specific dashboard

2. Organization Access:
   - New `/org/access` page for users without organization
   - Can enter organization ID to join existing org
   - Admins see additional option to register new org
   - After joining/creating org, redirected to appropriate dashboard

3. Role-Based Access:
   - Organization layout verifies user belongs to org
   - Admin/Employee layouts verify appropriate role
   - Cross-role redirects implemented (admin ↔ employee)

### Technical Implementation
1. Organization Layout (`[orgId]/layout.tsx`):
   - Verifies user session
   - Checks org membership
   - Verifies organization exists
   - Provides base layout for all org pages

2. Role Layouts:
   - Admin layout verifies admin role
   - Employee layout verifies employee role
   - Automatic role-based redirects

3. Dashboard Pages:
   - Role-specific dashboards (`/admin` and `/employee`)
   - Organization name and context displayed
   - Prepared for future dashboard widgets

### Security Improvements
1. Access Control:
   - Organization-level verification in base layout
   - Role-level verification in role layouts
   - All server actions use admin client for security

2. Route Protection:
   - All org routes require authentication
   - Dynamic routes verify org membership
   - Role-specific routes verify appropriate role

### Next Steps
1. Dashboard Features:
   - Add organization header/navigation
   - Implement dashboard widgets
   - Add organization settings

2. Team Management:
   - Team creation and management
   - Member invitations
   - Role assignments

3. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Loading states for transitions

4. Future Considerations:
   - Organization domain verification
   - SSO integration
   - Advanced role permissions

### Technical Decisions

1. Route Structure:
   - Used route groups for clear separation
   - Dynamic routes for org-specific pages
   - Shared layouts for common functionality

2. Access Control:
   - Layered verification (auth → org → role)
   - Admin client for secure operations
   - Role-based redirects for better UX

3. Data Flow:
   - Server components for data fetching
   - Client components for interactivity
   - Centralized auth logic

### Notes & Decisions

### Recent Updates - Display Name Implementation

#### Changes Made
1. Added display name field to organization signup form:
   - Required field with validation (2-50 characters)
   - Supports letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores
   - Client-side validation using Zod schema
   - Proper form field UI with description and error messages

2. Updated signup flow:
   - Display name is now collected during signup
   - Stored in auth metadata during user creation
   - Used for profile creation after email verification
   - Replaces previous auto-generation from email

3. Form Validation Rules:
   ```typescript
   displayName: z.string()
     .min(2, 'Display name must be at least 2 characters')
     .max(50, 'Display name must be less than 50 characters')
     .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_]+$/, 
       'Display name can only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores')
   ```

4. Data Flow:
   - User enters display name during signup
   - Passed to server action via FormData
   - Stored in auth metadata during user creation
   - Retrieved during email verification
   - Used to create profile with correct display name

This change ensures we have proper user identification from the start, rather than generating display names from email addresses.

### Status Update - Organization Registration Issues

#### Current Blockers
1. Organization Registration Not Functioning:
   - Organization-user relationship creation needs checking
   - Access page routing needs proper handling
   - Organization creation form and validation pending

#### Implementation Requirements
1. Organization Creation Flow:
   - Form for organization details (name, domain, etc.)
   - Server action for creating organization record
   - Proper handling of organization-user relationship
   - Role assignment for initial admin user
   - Success/error state management

2. Organization Join Flow:
   - Invite system implementation
   - Email verification for invites
   - Member role assignment
   - Organization access management
   - Proper error handling for invalid/expired invites

Next session will focus on implementing these missing pieces to complete the organization registration and access flows. 

## Recent Auth Changes & Security Notes (2024-01-09)

### Temporary RLS Bypass Implementation
To unblock development and focus on core functionality, we've implemented a temporary solution to bypass RLS policies:

1. Created a service client that bypasses RLS:
```typescript
export function createServiceClient() {
  return createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!,
    {
      auth: {
        autoRefreshToken: false,
        persistSession: false
      }
    }
  )
}
```

2. Updated auth flows to use service client for profile operations:
   - Sign-in flow uses service client for profile fetching
   - Auth callback uses service client for profile verification
   - Organization access/join uses service client for updates

### Security TODO (High Priority)
These changes are temporary and need to be replaced with proper security measures:

1. RLS Policies
   - Implement proper non-recursive RLS policies
   - Add row-level security for profiles table
   - Create organization-aware policies
   - Add proper role-based access control

2. Service Role Usage
   - Limit service role usage to absolutely necessary operations
   - Move sensitive operations to secure server actions
   - Implement proper middleware for role verification
   - Add audit logging for service role operations

3. Authentication Flow
   - Add proper session validation
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request validation
   - Enhance error handling and logging

4. Data Access
   - Implement proper data access patterns
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Create read/write segregation
   - Add proper error boundaries

### Next Security Steps
1. Audit current service role usage
2. Document all bypass points
3. Create proper RLS policy structure
4. Implement secure profile access
5. Add proper role verification
6. Create security test suite

**Note**: Current implementation prioritizes functionality over security to enable rapid development. This MUST be addressed before production deployment.
