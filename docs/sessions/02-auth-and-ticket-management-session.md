- [x] Add email verification and password reset emails
- [x] Create protected route middleware
- [x] Implement role-based access control
- [x] Add type-safe auth responses and error handling

### Form Implementation
- [x] Create type-safe forms using react-hook-form and zod
- [x] Add form validation and error handling
- [x] Implement loading states and success notifications
- [x] Add client-side validation
- [x] Create reusable form components

### Server Actions Implementation
- [x] Set up server actions for auth operations
- [x] Add type safety to server actions
- [x] Implement error handling and logging
- [x] Create reusable action patterns

### Navigation & Layout
- [x] Set up auth-specific layouts
- [x] Create customer dashboard layout
- [x] Add role-based navigation
- [x] Implement protected routes
- [x] Add loading and error states

### Database & Security
- [x] Set up RLS policies for profiles
- [x] Add team-based access control
- [x] Implement role-based permissions
- [x] Create type-safe database queries

## Technical Decisions

### Authentication
- Using Supabase Auth with SSR for better security
- Implementing role-based access control at middleware level
- Using type-safe forms with zod validation
- Server actions for better performance and security

### Database
- RLS policies for secure data access
- Team-based access control for scalability
- Role-based permissions for flexibility

### UI/UX
- Shadcn UI components for consistent design
- Loading states and error handling
- Type-safe form validation
- Success notifications and redirects

## Challenges & Solutions

### Cookie Handling
- Issue: Cookie management in Next.js 14 server components
- Solution: Updated cookie handling to use async/await pattern

### RLS Policies
- Issue: Profile creation failing due to RLS
- Solution: Added service role client for initial profile creation

### Redirect Handling
- Issue: Redirect caught in catch block
- Solution: Updated error handling to properly handle redirects

## Next Steps

### Employee/Admin Authentication (Priority)
1. Create employee/admin registration flow
   - Custom sign up form with role selection
   - Department and team selection
   - Manager approval workflow
2. Implement employee/admin sign in page
   - Role-specific validation
   - Department verification
3. Add role verification middleware
4. Set up approval workflows
5. Create role-specific redirects

### Role-Based Dashboards
1. Implement employee dashboard layout
2. Create admin dashboard layout
3. Add role-specific navigation
4. Implement access control middleware
5. Create dashboard stats components

### UI/UX Improvements
1. Add confirmation dialogs
2. Implement loading skeletons
3. Enhance form validation
4. Add error boundaries

### Testing
1. Add integration tests for auth flows
2. Test role-based access control
3. Validate RLS policies
4. Add error handling tests

### Documentation
1. Update API documentation
2. Add testing documentation
3. Document role-based features
4. Create user guides

## Notes
- Priority is employee/admin auth flows
- Need separate sign up pages for different roles
- Consider approval workflow for new employee accounts
- Plan for department/team management
- Need to ensure all redirects use correct paths
- Consider adding rate limiting for auth endpoints
