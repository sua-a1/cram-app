- Create UI components for notification display and interaction
- Set up database triggers for automatic notification creation
- Implement real-time updates and state management

## 2. Tasks & Commits
1. Database Setup

3. State Management & Real-time Updates
   - Implemented notification state management
   - Added real-time subscriptions with Supabase
   - Added pagination for notification list
   - Implemented mark-as-read functionality

## 3. Work Log & Code Changes

1. Database Setup:
   - Created notifications table in Supabase with fields: id, user_id, ticket_id, type, message, read, message_id, created_at, metadata
   - Added indexes on user_id, read status, and created_at
   - Implemented RLS policies for secure access

2. Trigger Functions:
   - Created handle_ticket_status_update() trigger for status changes
   - Created handle_new_message() trigger for message notifications
   - Fixed trigger functions to properly handle OLD/NEW record values

3. Component Implementation:
   - Created NotificationBell component with dropdown menu and badge
   - Implemented infinite scroll pagination
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Integrated toast notifications for new messages
   - Removed unused audio notification feature
   - Simplified navigation to always go to ticket page without message parameters

4. State Management:
   - Implemented real-time subscription in NotificationBell
   - Added unread count tracking
   - Implemented optimistic updates for read status
   - Added proper cleanup of subscriptions

5. Navigation:
   - Implemented deep linking to tickets and messages
   - Added proper route handling for different notification types
   - Fixed navigation paths for customer routes

## 4. Notes & Decisions

Key Decisions:
- Used Shadcn UI components for consistent design
- Implemented infinite scroll instead of traditional pagination
- Kept notifications in client state with real-time sync
- Used optimistic updates for better UX
- Simplified navigation to always go to ticket page

Technical Considerations:
- Proper handling of Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Separation of server and client components
- Type safety with proper TypeScript definitions

## 5. Next Steps
- Implement cleanup job for old notifications
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Add comprehensive testing
- Add notification sounds (optional)
- Document the notification system
