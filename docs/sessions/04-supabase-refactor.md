### Current Issues
1. Cookie Handling Types:
   - Need to fix cookie methods typing in Supabase clients
   - Update cookie storage adapter types
   - Fixed sign-in route cookie handling and error responses
   - Added proper JSON responses for all auth flows

2. Component Updates Needed:
   - Auth components need updating for new types
   - Form validation needs type safety
   - Loading states need proper typing

## 3. Work Log & Code Changes

### Auth Flow Improvements
1. Updated Customer Callback Route:
   - Converted to use new SSR package
   - Added proper cookie handling
   - Improved error handling
   - Maintained customer-specific profile creation

2. Updated Organization Callback Route:
   - Converted from page component to route handler
   - Added proper SSR implementation
   - Maintained org-specific logic (org_id, roles)
   - Added proper error handling
   - Fixed password reset flow redirection
   - Added proper next parameter handling

3. Password Reset Flow Fixes:
   - Updated reset password email template
   - Fixed callback route to handle password reset redirects
   - Added proper middleware access for update-password routes
   - Ensured correct URL redirection after password reset
   - Maintained separate flows for customer and org users

4. Type Safety Improvements
   - Updated Auth Types (`src/types/auth.ts`)
   - Updated Database Types (`src/types/database.types.ts`)
   - Created Central Type Exports (`src/types/index.ts`)

5. Build System Improvements
   - Updated PostCSS configuration for proper CSS processing
   - Fixed dependency versions for compatibility
   - Streamlined Next.js configuration
   - Resolved module resolution issues

## 4. Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. Auth Flow Organization:
   - Separate routes for customer and org auth
   - Shared cookie handling logic
   - Distinct profile creation per user type

2. Type Organization:
   - Separate files for auth and database types
   - Central export file for all types
   - Utility types for common patterns

3. Type Safety:
   - Strict null checks
   - Proper optional types
   - Type guards for runtime checks

4. Build Configuration:
   - Minimal Next.js config to leverage built-in features
   - Standard PostCSS setup with Tailwind
   - Fixed dependency versions for stability

### Next Steps
1. Fix Cookie Handling:
   - Update cookie storage adapter
   - Fix cookie method types
   - Add proper error handling

2. Update Components:
   - Refactor auth forms
   - Add type-safe validation
   - Update loading states

3. Error Handling:
   - Add proper error types
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add toast notifications
