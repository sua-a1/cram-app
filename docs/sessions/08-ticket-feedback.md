# Ticket Feedback Implementation Session

## 1. Session Goals
- Implement customer ticket feedback functionality
- Allow customers to provide star ratings and comments after ticket closure
- Set up proper testing for feedback components and actions

## 2. Tasks & Commits
1. Database Schema Updates
   - Added `ticket_feedback` table with rating and feedback fields
   - Set up RLS policies for customer feedback submission

2. Component Implementation
   - Created `TicketFeedbackPrompt` component for initial feedback request
   - Implemented `TicketFeedbackDialog` with star rating and comment input
   - Added toast notifications for user feedback

3. Testing Setup
   - Set up Jest configuration for component testing
   - Implemented comprehensive test suite for feedback components
   - Fixed mock implementations for toast and Supabase client

## 3. Work Log & Code Changes
1. Created feedback dialog component:
   - `/src/components/tickets/ticket-feedback-dialog.tsx`: Main feedback dialog with star rating and comment input
   - `/src/components/tickets/ticket-feedback-prompt.tsx`: Initial prompt to request feedback

2. Implemented server actions:
   - `/src/app/actions/tickets.ts`: Added `submitFeedback` function for handling feedback submission
   - Added validation for required rating and proper error handling

3. Test Implementation:
   - `/src/__tests__/tickets/ticket-feedback.test.tsx`: Comprehensive test suite for feedback components
   - `/src/__mocks__/hooks/use-toast.ts`: Mock implementation for toast notifications
   - Fixed Jest configuration to handle ES modules and component testing

## 4. Notes & Decisions
- Used Shadcn UI components for consistent styling and behavior
- Implemented star rating using custom styled buttons with Lucide icons
- Chose to make rating required but comments optional
- Used toast notifications for user feedback and error messages
- Decided to mock external dependencies (Supabase, toast) for reliable testing

### Testing Decisions:
- Created dedicated mock files for reusable mocks
- Used `jest.mock()` with factory functions to avoid hoisting issues
- Implemented comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Component rendering
  - User interactions
  - Success scenarios
  - Error handling
  - Validation

## 5. Next Steps
- Integrate feedback collection into analytics dashboard
- Add ability to view and manage feedback in admin interface
- Consider implementing email notifications for feedback submissions
- Add data visualization for feedback metrics
