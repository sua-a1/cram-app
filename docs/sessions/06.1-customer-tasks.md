# Session 06.1: Customer Message Interface Improvements

## Changes Made

### Message Display Order
- Fixed message ordering to consistently show most recent messages first
- Implemented proper sorting by `created_at` in descending order
- Added sorting after all state updates (insert, update, delete) to maintain consistency

### Message Sending Flow
- Fixed issue with MessageComposer getting stuck in "Sending..." state
- Improved state management in MessageComposer component
- Added proper cleanup of sending state
- Fixed Promise resolution between parent and child components

### Real-time Updates
- Added unique channel names with timestamps to prevent subscription conflicts
- Improved cleanup of subscriptions with mounted flag
- Added better error handling and logging for real-time events

### Hydration Fixes
- Added client-side only TimeAgo component to handle time display
- Fixed hydration mismatch errors in message timestamps
- Implemented auto-updating timestamps every minute
- Added proper datetime attributes for accessibility

## Known Issues

### Real-time Message Inconsistency
- Real-time updates in the customer message interface are still inconsistent
- Messages sometimes require a page refresh to appear
- Possible causes:
  - Race conditions between local state updates and real-time events
  - Multiple subscriptions interfering with each other
  - State updates not properly synchronized between components

## Next Steps

### Improve Real-time Reliability
- Consider implementing optimistic updates for better UX
- Add retry logic for failed real-time subscriptions
- Implement better state synchronization between components
- Add more detailed logging to track message flow

### Message Display
- Consider adding loading states for message operations
- Add visual feedback for message delivery status
- Implement proper error recovery for failed message sends

### Code Organization
- Consider extracting message handling logic into a custom hook
- Implement better TypeScript types for message events
- Add proper error boundaries for message components
