# Session Log: Initial Project Setup
Date: 2024-01-20

## 1. Session Goals
- Initialize the Next.js 13+ project with TypeScript and required dependencies
- Set up the project structure following the PRD and codebase organization rules
- Configure UI libraries (Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind)
- Begin Supabase integration setup
- Implement essential RLS policies
- Complete CRUD policies for all tables

## 2. Tasks & Commits
1. Project Initialization
   - Initialize Next.js 13+ with TypeScript
   - Configure ESLint and Tailwind
   - Set up proper directory structure

2. Documentation Setup
   - Create and organize /docs directory
   - Initialize checklists and session logs
   - Set up project documentation structure

3. Core Structure Setup
   - Created app directory route groups: (auth) and (dashboard)
   - Set up initial pages: login, admin, employee, tickets
   - Created shared dashboard layout
   - Added TypeScript types in /types
   - Created centralized tickets logic in /lib/server

4. Supabase Integration Setup
   - Created server-side Supabase utility (/lib/server/supabase.ts)
   - Created client-side Supabase utility for auth (/lib/client/supabase.ts)
   - Added TypeScript types for Supabase schema
   - Set up environment variables template
   - Implemented initial database schema
   - Added essential RLS policies
   - Completed CRUD policies for all tables

5. Auth & Landing Pages Setup
   - Created auth layout with split design (form/branding)
   - Implemented registration page with form and validation
   - Added root layout with metadata and Inter font
   - Created landing page with hero section and features
   - Set up error, loading, and not-found pages

## 3. Work Log & Code Changes
Current Status:
- Created initial checklist at /docs/checklists/01-initial-setup-checklist.md
- Created this session log
- Next.js project initialized with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind
- Set up Shadcn UI with required dependencies
- Created core app structure:
  - /app/(auth)/
    ✓ login/page.tsx
    ✓ register/page.tsx
    ✓ layout.tsx (split design with branding)
  - /app/(dashboard)/
    ✓ admin/page.tsx (with stats and team management)
    ✓ employee/page.tsx (with ticket queue)
    ✓ tickets/page.tsx (with filters and pagination)
    ✓ tickets/[id]/page.tsx (dynamic route)
    ✓ layout.tsx (shared dashboard layout)
  - /app/
    ✓ error.tsx (global error handling)
    ✓ not-found.tsx (404 page)
    ✓ loading.tsx (loading states)
    ✓ layout.tsx (root layout with metadata)
    ✓ page.tsx (landing page with features)
  - /types for shared interfaces
  - /lib/server for domain logic
  - /lib/client for client-side utilities

- Set up Supabase utilities and types:
  - Server-side admin client with service role
  - Client-side auth utilities with session management
  - Complete database types for all tables
  - Comprehensive RLS policies

## 4. Notes & Decisions
- Following Next.js 13+ App Router architecture
- Using Shadcn UI and Radix UI for components
- Centralizing domain logic in "mega files" as per codebase rules
- Created tickets-logic.ts as the central place for ticket-related business logic
- Separated Supabase clients for server/client usage following security best practices
- Implemented comprehensive RLS policies with business logic:
  - Time-based restrictions (e.g., 1-hour message deletion window)
  - Status-based permissions (e.g., only open tickets can be deleted)
  - Role-based access control
  - Hierarchical permissions (admin override capabilities)
- Using route groups for logical separation of auth and dashboard areas
- Server components by default, client components only for interactivity
- Proper error boundaries and loading states with Suspense

## 5. Next Steps
- Implement authentication flow using Supabase auth
- Add remaining UI components for tickets and dashboard
- Begin implementing core ticket management features
- Set up proper error handling and form validation
- Add dark mode support
- Implement proper navigation between routes
