## Known Issues & Limitations

2. Missing file attachment functionality
3. Need to implement knowledge base integration
4. Team management features pending

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Ticket Structure ✅
1. ✅ Set up ticket components in dashboard
   - Integrated in `/org/dashboard`
   - Real-time updates with Supabase
   - Modular component architecture

2. ✅ Create basic ticket components
   - TicketList with filters
   - TicketDialog for create/edit
   - TicketCard for display
   - Stats cards for metrics

3. ✅ Implement server actions for ticket operations
   - createTicket
   - updateTicket
   - Real-time sync

### Phase 2: Data Model & Types ✅
1. ✅ Define ticket interfaces and types
   ```typescript
   interface TicketWithDetails {
     id: string
     subject: string
     description: string
     status: TicketStatus
     priority: TicketPriority
     assigned_team?: string
     assigned_employee?: string
     handling_org_id: string
     user_id: string
     created_at: string
     // ... with additional relation fields
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Set up database schema and migrations
3. ✅ Implement RLS policies for ticket access

### Phase 3: UI Implementation ✅
1. ✅ Ticket listing with filters and sorting
2. ✅ Ticket creation/edit dialog with validation
3. ✅ Real-time updates and optimistic UI
4. ✅ Responsive layout and loading states

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement Customer Ticket Creation Flow
   - Create customer dashboard view
   - Add organization selector component
   - Implement ticket creation with org selection
   - Add real-time ticket status updates for customers
   - Show ticket history for customer's submissions

2. [ ] Enhance Ticket Management
   - [ ] Add file attachments
   - [ ] Implement team assignment
   - [ ] Add knowledge base integration

## Questions & Considerations
- How to structure the customer dashboard for optimal UX?
- Should we allow customers to select multiple organizations?
- How to handle organization verification for customers?
- What ticket details should be visible to customers vs employees?
- How to implement real-time updates securely for customer views?
