Here are a few additional considerations worth keeping in mind as you build out the Cram application:

## 1. Client-Side State Management
Since we already have a robust server-side data source (Supabase) and plan to leverage its real-time features, you may not need a large, heavy client-side store. Use client-side caching or minimal state management primarily for UI state (e.g., temporary filters, local form data, modals). Potential libraries or approaches:
- React Query / TanStack Query: Great for data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server.  
- Zustand: Useful if you prefer a lightweight approach to shared state without boilerplate. However, if your data is heavily real-time or ephemeral, a dedicated library like React Query might handle refresh/revalidation more elegantly.

Ultimately, you can choose any store that keeps your UI snappy, but be mindful of duplication of server data. Leverage server components for most data state whenever possible, and store ephemeral or interactive states in a client store if needed.

## 2. Rate Limiting
If you anticipate high traffic or want to protect your endpoints from abuse:
- Implement middleware-based rate limiting in Next.js (often via Edge Middleware) or at an API gateway (like Vercel’s Edge Config, or Cloudflare Workers, etc.).  
- Keep secrets out of the edge environment; just implement the checks (counts, IPs) at the edge, and log usage stats in a server or external datastore.  
- For Supabase-specific functions, you can rely on their built-in RLS and role-based access. Combine that with your rate-limiting approach for best results.

## 3. Edge Functions Best Practices
- Use edge functions (Next.js Edge Middleware or Supabase Edge Functions) for near-user tasks, such as rewriting bridging requests, simple validations, or controlling traffic at a global level.  
- Avoid heavy computations or resource-intensive operations at the edge, since the environment is more limited and can become costly.  
- Keep secrets and any privileged operations in server components or server-side environment variables, not in the edge layer.

## 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Incorporate some form of logging or monitoring early (e.g., simple logs in server actions, or third-party tools like Sentry, Logflare, or Datadog).  
- In Supabase, you can monitor logs and key metrics in the dashboard, but take advantage of external logging for app-level events if you need full observability.

## 5. Security
- Enforce RLS (Row-Level Security) in Supabase with precise policies for each table.  
- Keep environment variables secure (server-side) and do not expose service roles to client code.  
- Validate all user inputs on the server, especially for advanced queries or update endpoints.

## 6. Scalability & Performance
- Use React component-level caching or Next.js caching strategies for read-heavy data, if applicable.  
- For intense or background tasks (like large email campaigns or AI processing), consider running them as asynchronous jobs in a queue system or a separate worker function, not directly in your edge or route handlers.

## 7. Testing Strategy
- Write both integration tests (covering Next.js route handlers or server actions) and unit tests (business logic, domain-logic files).  
- With Supabase, you can use a testing environment or ephemeral database for each test suite.  
- Keep client tests minimal, focusing mostly on critical paths and UI interactions.

In short, you can typically keep your client state light if you’re already leveraging Next.js server components and Supabase real-time features. Rate limiting really depends on your usage patterns (and possible exposure to the public). Edge functions can be powerful for global rewrites or lightweight checks, but keep heavier logic in standard server components or a robust server environment for better security and resource management.
