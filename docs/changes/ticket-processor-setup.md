# Ticket Processor Setup - Changes and Pending Tasks

## Recent Changes

### 1. Document Embeddings and Retrieval
- Added `embedding` column to `knowledge_documents` table
- Created `document_embeddings` table for storing chunked document content
- Implemented document chunking and embedding generation
- Fixed document retrieval to properly join `document_embeddings` with `knowledge_documents`
- Added proper error handling and logging for document processing

### 2. Message Storage and Processing
- Added support for all message types (HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, ToolMessage)
- Implemented `author_role` field in message storage (`customer`, `employee`, `admin`)
- Added proper metadata handling for AI-generated content
- Fixed message type handling in `storeTicketMessage` function

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test-ticket-processor.ts`
- Implemented sequential conversation testing
- Added test ticket creation with proper fields
- Improved error handling and logging in tests

### 4. AI Agent Profile
- Created initial AI agent profile with ID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- Currently using a single agent profile for all organizations (temporary solution)

## Pending Tasks

### 1. Organization-Specific AI Agents
- [ ] Implement logic to create AI agent profiles per organization
- [ ] Add migration for creating AI agent profiles during organization creation
- [ ] Update ticket processor to use organization-specific AI agents
- [ ] Add proper access control for AI agent profiles

### 2. Organizational Context and Security
- [ ] Verify ticket processor maintains proper org_id context
- [ ] Add org_id checks for:
  - [ ] Document access and embeddings
  - [ ] Message storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Ticket processing
- [ ] Implement proper access control middleware
- [ ] Add logging for cross-organization access attempts

### 3. UI Integration
- [ ] Verify API endpoint integration with Cram App UI
- [ ] Test real-time message updates
- [ ] Implement proper error handling on the frontend
- [ ] Add loading states for ticket processing
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections for real-time updates

### 4. Testing and Monitoring
- [ ] Add unit tests for organizational context
- [ ] Implement integration tests for UI components
- [ ] Set up monitoring for:
  - [ ] API usage per organization
  - [ ] Document embedding usage
  - [ ] Processing times and performance
  - [ ] Error rates and types

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize document embedding retrieval
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed documents
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple tickets
- [ ] Optimize database queries for large organizations

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize organization-specific AI agent implementation
2. Add comprehensive org_id checks throughout the codebase
3. Complete UI integration testing
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Document API endpoints and integration patterns

## Notes
- Current AI agent profile is temporary and needs to be replaced with org-specific profiles
- Need to maintain careful separation of concerns between organizations
- Consider implementing rate limiting per organization
- Document all API endpoints and expected payloads
