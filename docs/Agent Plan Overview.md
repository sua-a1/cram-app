# Actionable Plan for Implementing the AI Agent

Below is a step-by-step outline for building a simple AI agent within the existing Cram repository, leveraging LangGraph for orchestration (and optionally LangSmith/LangFuse for monitoring). The plan is broken into key phases, with each phase including a lightweight deployment check to ensure the deployment pipeline works smoothly. A dedicated Phase Three focuses on more detailed logging, metrics analysis, and UI configuration.

---

## 1. Directory & Project Setup

1. **Keep the Agent in the Same Repo**  
   - In your existing Next.js + Supabase project, create a folder for the AI agent (e.g., “/agents”) to hold your LangGraph workflows, tool definitions, and integration scripts.  
   - This helps you maintain a single codebase for both the CRM and the agent logic.

2. **LangGraph Cloud Integration**  
   - If you plan to deploy the agent on LangGraph Cloud, initialize a sub-project within “/agents.”  
   - Provide environment variables (Supabase URL, service key, etc.) securely.

3. **Supabase pgvector Setup**  
   - Enable the pgvector extension in your Supabase database for storing embeddings.  
   - Create tables to store embeddings for knowledge base documents and conversation history.  
   - Optionally, create a table to log AI actions (e.g., each time the agent updates a ticket or escalates).
AFTER VERIFYING SUPABASE PGVECTOR WORKS CORRECTLY, DO THE FOLLOWING:
4. **Initial Deployment & Pipeline Check (Lightweight)**  
   - After setting up the directory structure, do a minimal “hello world” deployment of your agent to confirm the pipeline (e.g., single route processing) works on LangGraph Cloud or your chosen environment.  
   - Verify environment variables and basic connectivity to Supabase.

## 2. Phase One: Simple Agent for Ticket Interception

1. **Intercepting New Messages**  
   - In your Next.js server logic (route handler or server action), detect new messages (e.g., from customers).  
   - Forward these messages to your LangGraph agent before displaying them to human agents.

2. **Basic Retrieval & Response**  
   - The agent retrieves relevant knowledge or context from pgvector (if any).  
   - It produces a single-turn response using an LLM chain based on the supplied context.

3. **Tools Introduced**  
   - “Send Customer Message”: The agent can post a reply to the user on the ticket thread.  
   - “Close Ticket”: If the conversation clearly resolves the user’s issue and the user agrees, the agent can finalize the ticket.  
   - “Update Ticket Status” or “Update Priority”: If the agent sees a need to label the ticket differently (e.g., from “open” to “in-progress”), it may call this tool.

4. **Escalation Criteria (Simple Version)**  
   - If the agent’s confidence is too low, or if the user explicitly requests a human, the agent calls “Escalate to Human.”  
   - This changes the ticket status to something like “Escalated” and notifies a human agent.

5. **Phase One Deployment & Testing**  
   - Deploy this simple agent to your chosen environment, verifying that new messages trigger the agent’s logic.  
   - Perform some basic tests to ensure the agent can respond or escalate.  
   - Confirm that “Send Customer Message” and “Close Ticket” calls are working end-to-end in your CRM.

## 3. Phase Two: Memory & Multi-Step Conversations

1. **Conversation Memory**  
   - Implement short-term memory to maintain context across multiple user-agent exchanges.  
   - Store older messages in pgvector for retrieval if the conversation goes beyond the short-term buffer.

2. **Multi-Step Reasoning & Tool Calls**  
   - The agent might use multiple tools within a single thread (e.g., “Update Ticket Status,” “Send Customer Message,” “Close Ticket,” etc.).  
   - Incorporate logic for chain-of-thought with multiple steps in a single conversation (LangGraph’s multi-step workflows).

3. **Refined Escalation Logic**  
   - Add keywords or organizational policies that trigger escalation (e.g., “legal,” “unresolved billing”).  
   - Allow admins to configure these triggers in a “settings” table so the agent can fetch them on initialization.

4. **Embedding & Retrieval Enhancement**  
   - Expand your retrieval pipeline to include ticket conversation history, knowledge base, and internal notes.  
   - Merge short-term memory with retrieved docs for more accurate answers.

5. **Phase Two Deployment & Testing**  
   - Deploy updated agent logic to the same environment or a staging environment.  
   - Run multi-turn conversation tests in your CRM to confirm memory and multi-step tool calls behave as expected.  
   - Verify that refined escalation triggers fire correctly.

## 4. Phase Three: Deployment & Monitoring

1. **Comprehensive Deployment**  
   - Finalize the agent’s LangGraph code for production deployment.  
   - Ensure any environment variables, secrets, and pgvector configurations are set up in your production environment.

2. **Detailed Logging & Metrics Analysis**  
   - Integrate LangSmith/LangFuse or similar logging to capture:  
     - Tool calls (e.g., “Update Ticket Status,” “Close Ticket”)  
     - Agent confidence scores  
     - Escalation events vs. direct resolution  
   - Track at least two accuracy metrics (e.g., success rate in picking the correct action, speed of response).

3. **Admin Configuration UI**  
   - Provide a simple admin UI in the CRM to adjust confidence thresholds, escalation keywords, or maximum retries.  
   - This ensures the agent can adapt to organizational needs without code redeploy.

4. **Final Testing & Validation**  
   - Document 20–30 test scenarios (both simple and complex).  
   - Use LangSmith/LangFuse dashboards to confirm accuracy metrics (e.g., correct tool usage, error rates) meet your targets.  
   - Conduct a short screen recording (3–5 min) demonstrating the AI agent in action and showing how you track metrics.

## 5. Putting It All Together

With this final setup:

1. **New Ticket or Message**  
   - The system intercepts the user’s message, calls the agent.  
2. **Agent Retrieval & Reasoning**  
   - The agent uses embeddings to find relevant context, referencing short-term memory for continuity.  
3. **Tool Calls & Escalation**  
   - The agent decides to “Send Customer Message,” “Update Ticket Status,” or “Close Ticket,” or escalate if the conversation meets the configured criteria.  
4. **Logging & Metrics**  
   - All activity is recorded in LangSmith/LangFuse, allowing you to measure success rate, response speed, and error rates.  
5. **Deployment Pipeline at Each Phase**  
   - Regular deployments ensure early detection of any pipeline or environment issues, while final Phase Three adds refined monitoring and a dedicated admin UI.

This revised plan gives you a clear, incremental path—each phase validated by a small deployment check—ultimately culminating in a robust, memory-capable AI agent with comprehensive monitoring, metrics, and an admin-configurable escalation workflow.
