1. Organize Server & Client Components (Next.js 13+)  
• Use server components for non-interactive or data-centric operations (e.g., querying Supabase tables, handling auth tokens), keeping browser logic out of the bundle.
• Include "use client" only when you need client-side interactivity (e.g., handling form inputs, real-time UI updates).
• This separation ensures lighter client bundles and better performance.
2. Utilize Dedicated Server Utilities for Supabase
• In Next.js 13, place your Supabase interaction logic in dedicated server utility modules (e.g., /app/lib/server/supabase.ts).
• Centralize database queries (e.g., selecting, inserting, or updating records), storage operations, and server-side auth checks in these modules.
• Limit direct imports of these modules to server components or route handlers (in /app/api) to avoid shipping sensitive code to the client.
3. Use Route Handlers & Server Components for Data Fetching
• For SSR in Next.js 13, query Supabase within server components or route handlers (e.g., /app/api/someData/route.ts).
• Return the necessary data to your front-end components as props to keep the client-side code minimal.
• Ensure any environment variables (like Supabase service role keys) remain purely server-side.
4. Handle Supabase Auth Securely
• Streamline authentication by calling Supabase auth methods on the server, especially for admin-level operations.
• For client login or signup flows, use the Supabase client library in a “use client” component. This will keep the user experience interactive while maintaining security by not exposing privileged tokens.
• Always store sensitive credentials and keys in .env files and never commit them to version control.
5. Avoid Client-Side Bundle Bloat
• Don’t bundle Node-specific packages or server logic in client components—e.g., file system operations or direct access to environment variables.
• Keep complex queries or transformations on the server (via server components or route handlers) to reduce overhead on the client side.
• Client components should focus on UI and real-time interactions (e.g., listening to Supabase changes via client library subscriptions).
6. Careful Management of Environment Variables
• Put Supabase service role (or other privileged) keys in .env files, accessible only on the server side.
• Expose only public keys or anon keys to the client (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) when absolutely required for client operations.
• Avoid mixing secrets and public variables in the same environment file.
7. Supabase Storage & File Handling
• Use server components or route handlers to manage secure file uploads/downloads with Supabase Storage.
• If needed, abstract the logic in a server utility function (e.g., uploadFileToSupabase) to keep the flow consistent and prevent exposing private file paths or tokens in client code.
8. Testing & Type Checking
• Type-check all Supabase responses (e.g., using TypeScript’s built-in types or a generated schema) to ensure data consistency across your application.
• Write server-side tests for important Supabase operations like inserts or transactions to validate business logic.
• Continue to run tsc in CI to confirm that imports remain in the correct environment (server vs. client).
By following these guidelines, you’ll keep your Next.js + Supabase application secure, high-performing, and maintainable—ensuring that database queries, auth logic, and storage operations stay on the server side and sensitive keys remain protected.
